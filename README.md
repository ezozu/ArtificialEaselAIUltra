# ArtificialEaselAIUltra

## Description

A generative art framework leveraging transformer-based neural networks and GAN architectures to create unique, AI-generated NFTs, utilizing a novel entropy-based rarity metric and on-chain provenance verification.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtificialEaselAIUltra software project:
- "Trains neural networks using a novel attentionbased architecture for improved artistic style transfer",
- "Generates highresolution images up to 4K resolution using a custom CUDAaccelerated renderer",
- "Analyzes artistic compositions using a proprietary saliency map algorithm to optimize visual balance",
- "Supports realtime collaboration through WebSocketsbased live updating of artwork states",
- "Integrates with popular graphics tablets via a custom Wacom driver for enhanced drawing experiences",
- "Optimizes color palettes using a genetic algorithmbased approach for maximum aesthetic appeal",
- "Provides a Python API for programmatic access to AIgenerated artwork metadata and generation parameters"
- Let me know if you need any modifications!
